# Simple Calculator
## Python project
In this project, we are creating a simple calculator thta can add, subtract, multiply or divide depending on the user input.
For this project, knowledge of the following python topics is needed:
1. User-defied functions.
2. Functions
3. Function Arguments

## About
We request the user to select an operation in this program. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all viable choices. 
Any further input results will display **Invalid Input**, and the loop keeps going until a valid option is chosen.

A particular segment is carried out by using an if...elif...else branching and two numbers. 
The user-defined functions multiply(), divide(), add(), and subtract() evaluate their associated operations and display the output.

The output:
